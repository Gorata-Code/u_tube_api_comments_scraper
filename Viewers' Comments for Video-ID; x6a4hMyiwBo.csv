vlogbrothers,"Reply with some good movie and media recommendations here. NO BUMMERS. Hank, as someone who found the film Big Bird Comes Home a little emotionally overwhelming (because Big Bird leaves home and gets very scared before, get this, eventually coming home again), here are my recommendations:<br>1. All nine Fast and Furious movies in order (there are bummers but the bummers happen alongside, like, cars in space, so they do not feel like huge bummers)<br>2. Harvey (zero bummers)<br>3. Happy Gilmore (lowest stakes of any film ever made)<br>I love you. We all love you. You&#39;ve got this. -John",2023-05-19,15:20:24,39362
TheGoldenAquarius,"I just stumbled upon this channel like, a few minutes ago, and I don&#39;t know much about you, Hank, but I&#39;m rooting for you. My father had cancer a few years ago, and so did a close friend of mine. Luckily, they both won their battles. I&#39;ve always supported them, and I hope you&#39;ll beat cancer too.",2023-05-20,10:37:28,0

Brody Eden,"Praying for you man. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re religious or not but if you ask Jesus to help you, He will. Jesus is here for you and that He died for you so that you can have the choice to spend eternity in Heaven with Him if you choose to accept Him as Your Lord and Saviour, because He gave us all the free will to make our own choices. Having a friendship and relationship with Him is the best thing you could ever have and getting to know Him and His character is also one of the best things you could ever do üòä<br>I don&#39;t want you to miss out on Heaven man but you see if people choose not to accept Jesus as their Lord and Saviour because they don&#39;t want anything to do with God then God won&#39;t force them to love Him, but He will give them what they want. And the only place where God isn&#39;t is in hell so God will only send people there if they don&#39;t want anything to do with Him cuz the only place that doesn&#39;t have God&#39;s presence is hell. And I don&#39;t want you to go there so please consider knowing God and understanding Him, I can&#39;t promise you will have an easier life if you do choose to follow Him but remember that no matter how bad things can get in this world, just remember that God is always good",2023-05-20,10:35:30,0

Fanta,"yk this would be the perfect time to watch this video called &quot;gifted with cancer&quot; by Ali Banat. He was rich, young and successful but was diagnosed with cancer and completely turned his life around to focus more on his spiritual well being rather than his physical. He embarked on all sorts of philanthropy and did all he could to give back before his time was up. V inspiring and makes us think more about time, our purpose and our afterlife. Maybe this is a sign from god to be closer to Him?",2023-05-20,10:32:42,0
